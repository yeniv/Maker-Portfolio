          An 11-minute documentary following a team of engineers building an amphibious vehicle prototype for the Canadian Armed Forces
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no ports in the Arctic, so there's no easy way to get personnel and equipment from offshore patrol vessels onto land and inland. WAL-LE solves this problem and is the missing link between Canadian forces and the Arctic terrain.

          This film gives a behind-the-scenes look into the passion and skill required to assemble, test, and reconfigure an ambitious project like WAL-LE.
